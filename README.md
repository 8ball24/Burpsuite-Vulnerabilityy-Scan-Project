## Intercept HTTP traffic with Burp Proxy
In this step, I intercept requests using Burp Proxy. Burp Proxy allows me to intercept HTTP requests and responses between Burp's browser and the target server, which helps in understanding website behaviour during different actions.

Step 1
First, I navigate to the "Proxy Intercept" tab and click the "Intercept is off" button to toggle it to "Intercept is on." Then, I click "Open Browser" to launch Burp's browser, which is already configured to work seamlessly with Burp.

 ![2b](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/8e35baf9-e257-4a8b-93bf-946372be57aa)

 
Step 2
With both Burp and Burp's browser open, I attempt to visit portswigger.net using the browser. I notice that the site doesn't load because Burp Proxy has intercepted the HTTP request before it reached the server. I can view and even modify this intercepted request on the "Proxy Intercept" tab.
 
![2c](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/a423137d-f506-4c80-8068-84afe266de73)

Step 3
To proceed, I click the "Forward" button multiple times to send the intercepted request and any subsequent ones until the page loads in Burp's browser.Since intercepting every single request can be overwhelming, I toggle the "Intercept is on" button back to "Intercept is off." This allows me to interact with the website normally.  

![2d](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/44fc90cd-8de5-44bf-ba8e-79cde2b2ce92)

Step 4
In Burp, I navigate to the "Proxy HTTP History" tab. Here, I can see the history of all HTTP traffic passing through Burp Proxy, even when interception was turned off. By clicking on any entry in the history, I can view the raw HTTP request and its corresponding response from the server. This enables me to explore the website normally and study the interactions between Burp's browser and the server conveniently.

## Modifying HTTP requests with Burp Proxy
In this step, I modify intercepted requests using Burp Proxy, allowing me to manipulate requests in unexpected ways to observe website responses. To follow along, I need an account on portswigger.net, which is free and grants full access to the Web Security Academy.

Step 1
First, I ensure that interception is turned off in the "Proxy Intercept" tab in Burp. Then, I launch Burp's browser and visit the lab titled "Excessive Trust and Client-side Controls."

 ![3a](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/04f4fbde-5135-49f3-9b57-dc96a4ca60eb)

Step 2
After logging into my portswigger.net account, I'm directed to a fake shopping website. I log in using the provided credentials, and with $100 store credit, I proceed to view the product details for a lightweight leather jacket.

 ![3b](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/b2da188c-b31d-4973-bbff-9a968a94734d)

Step 3
I switch interception on in Burp and add the leather jacket to my cart. By intercepting the resulting POST request, I study its parameters, specifically the "price" parameter, which I modify to 1 cent before forwarding the modified request to the server. 

 ![3c](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/d6849774-ea30-49bc-9dc3-bb206c551a8d)

Step 4
After switching interception off again, I navigate to my cart in Burp's browser and observe that the jacket is indeed priced at 1 cent, a modification not possible through the web interface.

 ![3d](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/233e193d-6695-4631-89ad-3059323c7fbc)

Step 5
Finally, I purchase the jacket at the altered price, effectively completing the lab. Through this exercise, I've gained insights into intercepting, reviewing, and manipulating HTTP traffic using Burp Proxy.

## Set the target scope
In this step, I configure target scope in Burp Suite and outline the various purposes it serves. Target scope is crucial for informing Burp about what you're testing, helping to enhance efficiency and control during testing.

Step 1
To configure target scope, I navigate to the "Target" tool and access the "Scope" tab. By default, no URLs are in scope, and I add URLs by including them in the "Include" list. If needed, I can exclude certain items by adding them to the "Exclude" list. A URL is considered in scope if it matches something in the "Include" list and doesn't match anything in the "Exclude" list. I studied the HTTP history in Burp by navigating to Proxy > HTTP history tab. Sorting the requests in descending order to easily view the most recent ones.

 ![4a](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/1dfc1847-7115-4255-8d5e-daad5021b648)

Step 2
Common configurations involve including a single domain, a folder or path within a domain, or multiple domains and paths together. Exclude rules can be used to exclude irrelevant content, out-of-scope functionality, or fragile features. Set the target scope by going to Target > Site map. Right-click on the node for the target site and select "Add to scope." Confirm excluding out-of-scope traffic when prompted.

![4b](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/c51fbf86-8ea1-487b-9b78-9340a7d9ef08)


Step 3
By default, target scope works off simple URL prefixes, but enabling advanced scope control allows for defining scope rules based on individual parts of the URL, such as the protocol, host, port, or file path, using regular expressions if needed. Filter the HTTP history by selecting "Show only in-scope items" from the display filter above the HTTP history. Now, scroll through the HTTP history to see that it only displays entries from the target website, simplifying your view.

 ![4c](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/e12a2250-0e7f-4e2f-99c9-741d8733ed41)

The easiest way to define scope is by browsing the target application with Burp's browser and using the context menu on the site map or tree to add or remove items from scope. Browsing the target site, note that out-of-scope traffic is no longer logged in the site map or proxy history.

 ![4d](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/dab49871-6b09-4658-98e2-589817c47f23)

Target scope serves various purposes:
1. Keeping data clean by prompting to stop sending out-of-scope items to the proxy history or other Burp tools.
2. Filtering views in the site map and proxy history to show only in-scope items.
3. Defining interception rules based on target scope.
4. Automatically pre-configuring URLs for scans.
5. Configuring crawl options to fetch outer scope resources during scans.
6. Setting the scope of live tasks.
7. Customizing search functions to include only in-scope items.
8. Controlling intruder behaviour, including following redirections based on scope.
9. Configuring session handling rules based on target scope.
10. Dropping out-of-scope requests within Burp.

## Reissue requests with Burp Repeater
In this tutorial, I'll demonstrate how to utilize Burp Repeater to repeatedly send an interesting request, allowing for detailed analysis of the target website's responses without needing to intercept the request each time. This streamlined process simplifies vulnerability probing and verification, especially in conjunction with Burp Scanner's findings.

Step 1: Identify an intriguing request. During the previous tutorial, you explored a mock shopping website where each visit to a product page triggered a GET request (/product) with a productId query parameter.

![Screenshot (4)](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/33a4c928-1ce2-40df-9737-355c8cdfe9e9)
 
Step 2: Send the request to Burp Repeater. Right-click on any of the GET /product?productId=[...] requests from the HTTP history in Burp Proxy and select "Send to Repeater."

 ![Screenshot (5)](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/f6f77039-7af4-4b0c-b5d1-ac1eb50a4f2b)

Step 3: View and resend the request in Burp Repeater. Navigate to the Repeater tab to find the request awaiting your attention in its own numbered tab. Click "Send" to send the request and view the server's response. You can resend the request multiple times, observing updated responses each time. 

 ![5b](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/26f6e633-165f-4409-b840-e1fbb14f4160)

By leveraging Burp Repeater, you can meticulously analyze the behavior of the target website, repeating requests effortlessly to scrutinize responses and uncover potential vulnerabilities.

## Testing different input with Burp Repeater
Step 1: I started by resending the request with different input. Specifically, I focused on altering the number in the productId parameter. This involved changing the number to various arbitrary values, including some larger ones. By doing this, I aimed to identify potential vulnerabilities related to different inputs. I changed the productid from 10 to 100 and got this response.

 ![6a](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/82239c37-0cba-49db-ad73-7d5cc6fbe71e)

Step 2: After experimenting with different input, I moved on to view the request history. Using Burp Repeater, I utilized the arrows to navigate back and forth through the history of requests I had sent. This allowed me to inspect the responses corresponding to each request. The drop-down menu next to each arrow also enabled me to jump to a specific request within the history. This step was crucial for understanding how the server responded to different inputs and for investigating particular inputs further.

 ![Screenshot (6)](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/73e799d7-17b3-4718-96cc-16644b16812c)


Step 3: With a better understanding of the request history, I proceeded to try sending unexpected input. Since the server appeared to expect an integer value via the productId parameter, I decided to test its behavior with a different data type. I submitted another request where the productId was a string of characters, aiming to observe how the server would handle such unexpected input. 

 ![6a](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/e8d89306-5f65-4a5f-9eef-fc5fd776815c)
![6d](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/0dcf038a-6be1-467b-9bc4-b96555cabfb2)

Step 4: Upon studying the response to the unexpected input, I noticed that sending a non-integer productId resulted in an exception. The server sent back a verbose error response containing a stack trace, revealing information about its underlying framework. Specifically, the response indicated that the website was using the Apache Struts framework and even disclosed the version being used. In a real-world scenario, such information could be valuable to an attacker, particularly if the framework version is known to contain additional vulnerabilities.

 ![6c](https://github.com/8ball24/Burpsuite-Vulnerabilityy-Scan-Project/assets/162763700/d2ee0f15-841b-469e-b241-dfc4bf1684a5)

Finally, armed with the knowledge of the leaked framework version, I returned to the lab in Burp's browser. I clicked the "Submit solution" button and entered the Apache Struts version number that I had discovered in the response (2 2.3.31). This action confirmed that I successfully identified an information disclosure vulnerability using Burp Repeater, thus completing another lab.
